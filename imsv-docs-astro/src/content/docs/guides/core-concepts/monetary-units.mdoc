All monetary values must be formatted as an integer in the smallest
denomination for the given currency. The smallest denomination
for stablecoin assets is typically not the same as the smallest unit used for
payment in the fiat equivalent currency.

Examples:

* Two-decimal fiat currency (for example US Dollars): $13.14 USD, amount will be `1314`.
* Zero-decimal fiat currency (for example Japanese Yen): Â¥1314 JPY, amount will be `1314`.
* Six-decimal crypto assets (for example USDC): $13.14 USDC, amount will be `13140000`.


## Currency Codes

Fiat currencies are specified with an [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) code.


## Converting USDC to USD

USDC is pegged 1:1 for USD, the smallest possible unit of USDC represents one
10,000th of 1 USD cent. For example: 5,000,000 USDC minor units = 500 USD minor
units (cents).

|  Fiat Amount | Fiat Minor Units | Token Minor Units |
|-|-|-|
| $5.00 USD | 500 USD cents | 5000000 USDC |
