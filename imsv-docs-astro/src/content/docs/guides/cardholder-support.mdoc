When a cardholder encounters an issue that requires assistance from Immersve to resolve then partners can generate a support page URL and direct the cardholder to that URL.

## Create a support session

Use the endpoint [create a support session](/api-reference/create-a-support-session) to initiate a support session for a cardholder and direct them to the provided support page URL.
