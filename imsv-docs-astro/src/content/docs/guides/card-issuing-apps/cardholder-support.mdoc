title: Cardholder support
---

When a cardholder encounters an issue that requires assistance from Immersve to
resolve then partners can generate a support page URL and direct the cardholder
to that URL.

## Create a support session

Use the {% link endpoint="create-support-session" /%} endpoint
to initiate a support session for a cardholder and direct them to the provided
support page URL.
