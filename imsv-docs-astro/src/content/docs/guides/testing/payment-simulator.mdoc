The simulator app is a test application that enables use of Immersve cards with
a fake merchant.

To begin using the simulator, one must first create an Immersve test card with
the following steps:

- Visit <https://app.immersve.com/config> and toggle `ENABLE_TEST_MODE` to on
- Go to <https://app.immersve.com> and sign in with a new web3 wallet (donâ€™t
  use your existing wallet)
- Create a card

Once a card is acquired you can go to <https://app.immersve.com/simulator> to use
the simulator.

**NOTE:** You must stay logged into your Immersve account while using the
simulator.

Once on the simulator app, you will be given a form to enter your card details
into, as well as a series of options as indicated by the flow diagram below.

At any point the `reset` button can be used to restore the application to its
initial state, not maintaining any previous transaction history.


## Authorization

An `authorization` is an initial step in a transaction that checks if funds are
available and sets up the approval for the transaction. At this point the
transaction is initialized, with an initial hold being made on the funds,
however no funds are settled with the merchant itself.

The amount being supplied as the value for such an authorization cannot exceed
the funds initially allocated to the card on creation.

When the authorization has succeeded, a transaction will show up on the Immersve
apps dashboard with a processed date of `pending`


## Clearing

A clearing acts in a very similar way to clearing without auth, however the
card information that is used is based upon the initial authorization that was
executed. When executing this `clearing` action, the user is prompted to enter
a value. This allows for partial clearings to be made, where the amount being
cleared may be less than the initial amount of authorized funds.

Like with direct clearing without auth, this step will process the transaction,
changing its status to the current date in the Immersve dashboard.


## Clearing Without Auth

Instead of authorizing first, a payment can be made by outright creating a
`clearing`. This clearing creates a debit for the account, allowing for
reconciliation to be executed with the merchant. At this point, the transaction
is considered to be processed.

When this clearing is made successfully, a transaction will show up in the
Immersve apps dashboard with a processed date of the current day.


## Reversal

After any of `clearing`, `clearing without auth` and `authorization` have been
completed, the transaction can also be reversed using the `reverse` button.
When this action is executed, a modal will allow the user to enter a value that
is to be reversed. This can be less than the initial value of the previous
action, allowing for a partial reversal of the transaction.

Once reversed, the transaction in the Immersve dashboard will show as having
its value reduced by the amount that was entered within the process.
