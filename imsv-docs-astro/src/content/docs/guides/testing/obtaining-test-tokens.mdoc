Immersve uses the official USDC [testnet
token](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/usdc-on-test-networks)
from Circle. Circle provides a testnet [faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) for
obtaining tokens on most Immersve {% link page="guides/supported-chains" /%}.

If the global quota of testnet USDC minting has been reached, [Circle
Discord](https://discord.com/invite/buildoncircle) support can also help
providing testnet USDC on demand.
