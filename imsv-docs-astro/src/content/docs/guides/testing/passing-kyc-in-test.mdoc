This guide explains how to provide KYC data to our test environment to consistently pass KYC. This is useful
for getting onto the platform and testing your integrations.

## Testing Partner Conducted KYC

To consistently pass {% link page="guides/partner-conducted-kyc" /%} in test,
you will need to supply a unique identity and unique address. This avoids your
KYC application failing as a duplicate.


{% endpointref name="submit-kyc-statement" /%}

### Update the Claims
To create a unique identity and unique address, you will need to replace some parts of
 the partner statement with unique values and key words within different claims.
{% list %}
  {% listitem "ArrowRightCircle" %}
    __Adjust Full Name claim__ <br/>
    Generate unique values for `givenName` and `familyName` fields
    __and__ ensure the `middleName` is `passall`.
  {% /listitem %}
  {% listitem "ArrowRightCircle" %}
    __Adjust Date of Birth claim__ <br/>
    Generate a unique date in the past for the `dateOfBirth` field.
  {% /listitem %}
  {% listitem "ArrowRightCircle" %}
    __Adjust Address claim__ <br/>
    Populate the `streetNumber`, `streetName`, and `town` with unique values. <br/>

    Make sure that the other geographic details (`region`, `state`, `country`) of the
    address align with the kyc region you are submitting the statement for.
  {% /listitem %}
{% /list %}


## Testing Immersve Conducted KYC

To consistently pass {% link page="guides/immersve-conducted-kyc" /%} in test, you should not need to do anything different from the normal process.

A test document is available for use instead of your own identity documents, however
you will still need to use a real person's face for the facial scan.

### Upload document and perform a facial scan

When you get to the document and facial scanning steps, you will need to:

{% list %}
  {% listitem "ArrowRightCircle" %}
    __Upload a scan of a document__ <br/>
    You can use your own valid identity document e.g. drivers license or passport
    __OR__
    a test document provided further down in this guide.
  {% /listitem %}
  {% listitem "ArrowRightCircle" %}
    __Scan your face__  <br/>
    The facial scan __must__ be done with a real person's face. It does not
    need to match the supplied document.
  {% /listitem %}

{% /list %}
A randomly generated profile will be created in the background to replace the
data that has been uploaded.

## Example Test Documents

If you're not comfortable using your identity documents, we have provided a
dummy drivers license that can be used instead of a real identity document.
