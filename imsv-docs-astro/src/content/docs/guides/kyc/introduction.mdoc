The KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process is a crucial requirement in financial operations to verify the
identity of individuals or entities engaging in transactions. This process helps prevent fraudulent activities and
ensures compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.

All individuals must complete the KYC process before they can issue and
use the Immersve card. This includes individuals who obtain the card through Immersve partners.
Cardholders need to be a resident in one of our {% link page="guides/regions" /%}.
