  How to handle instructions from the Get Spending Prerequisites endpoint for
  Immersve cardholder onboarding.
---


The "kyc" stage of the {% link endpoint="get-spending-prerequisites" /%}
endpoint response provides integrators with dynamic instructions that guide
users through identity verification. These instructions adapt based on the
user's current progress, regional regulations, and the integration style (either
{% link page="guides/partner-conducted-kyc" /%} or {% link
page="guides/immersve-conducted-kyc" /%}).

This guide explains the ***possible KYC prerequisite actions*** your application
may need to handle and the ***expected KYC user onboarding scenarios*** where these
actions appear. By understanding both the individual actions and the context in
which they appear, integrators can create a seamless and compliant KYC
experience for users.


## KYC Prerequisite Scenarios

The following sections show indicative KYC prerequisite instructions that will
be returned from the {% link endpoint="get-spending-prerequisites" /%} endpoint under various
cardholder onboarding scenarios. The "funding" and "aml" prerequisite
instructions are excluded for brevity.


### New Cardholder

A first-time user who has not yet started the Immersve KYC session. Additional
KYC instructions such as "submit_contact_phone" will also be included if those
details have not been supplied and the relevant Immersve KYC steps have been
requested to be skipped.

```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "action-required",
  "actionType": "follow_kyc_url",
  "params": {
    "kycUrl": "https://verify.immersve.com/08c37"
  }
}]
```

### New Cardholder (Partner Conducted)

A first-time user for whom a partner-conducted KYC statement has not been
received. Additional KYC instructions such as "submit_contact_phone" will also
be included if those have not been supplied.

```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "action-required",
  "actionType": "submit_kyc_statement"
}]
```


### Background Checks In-Progress

When all information has been submitted by actioning the KYC instructions the
KYC instruction will have status "pending" while background checks are being
completed.

```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "pending"
}]
```

### Background Checks Failed (Partner Conducted)
When cardholder KYC checks have been completed, but some checks have failed or more information is required. A reason code may be included to explain why the application was not successful. Reason codes are detailed at the bottom of this guide.
```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "action-required",
  "actionType": "submit_kyc_statement",
  "params": {
    "reasons": [
      { "code": "ADDRESS_NOT_VERIFIED" }
    ]
  }
}]
```


### KYC Requirements Completed

When all cardholder KYC checks have been completed successfully then a
prerequisite instruction will indicate the KYC stage is "ok".

```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "ok",
}]
```


### Background Checks Permanently Failed

If a cardholder account has failed KYC checks and retry is not allowed then the
status will be "blocked".

```json
[{
  "stage": "kyc",
  "status": "blocked"
}]
```


## KYC Prerequisite Actions

This section lists all possible KYC prerequisite actions that may be returned by
the {% link endpoint="get-spending-prerequisites" /%} endpoint. Each action describes a specific user
task or information request that must be completed before proceeding. For each
action, we explain: what the instruction means, what is the unique identifier
(the "actionType" field), and what additional parameters are included. Understanding
these actions is key to building flexible and user-friendly KYC flows.
