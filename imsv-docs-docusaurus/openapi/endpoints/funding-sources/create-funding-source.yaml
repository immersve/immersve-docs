  summary: Create a funding source for an account
  description: |
    This endpoint can be used to claim a web3 address as a source of funds. The funding address may be an EOA or a smart contract implementing the ERC-1271 interface. If the address is a smart contract, the `ownerAddress`, `message`, and `signature` fields are required.<br/>
    The [Create challenge endpoint](/api-reference/create-challenge) can be used to prove ownership of a web3 address by signing the returned message.
