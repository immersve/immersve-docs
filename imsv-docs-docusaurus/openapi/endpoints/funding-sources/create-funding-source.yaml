  summary: Create a funding source for an account
  description: |
    Funding Sources define the mechanism for how card payments will be funded. A
    Funding Source's Funding Channel defines its purpose, protocol, and asset
    type as well as any other common parameters. Other parameters vary depending
    on the type of Funding Channel and also vary by the funding address
    validation mode if applicable.

    Funding Sources with on-chain Funding will have a fundingAddress attribute.
    The address will vary depending on the protocol variant in use. For a
    universal protocol variant it will be the deposit sender address. For flexi
    protocol variants it will be the deposit recipient address. See [Funding
    Protocols](https://docs.immersve.com/guides/funding-protocols/) for more
    details about funding protocols.

    The purpose of a Funding Source is inherited from its Funding Channel. If
    the Funding Source has a "billing" purpose, then it cannot be used to fund
    cards directly. Rather, it will be used to create a custodial Funding
    Channel.

    #### Request Variants

    **Login Wallet** Create a Funding Source using a funding address which is
    already connected with a verified login wallet for the owner account.

    **Wallet Signature** Create a Funding Source using funding address which
    can be verified with a separate signing challenge. The [Create challenge
    endpoint](/api-reference/create-challenge) can be used to generate the
    signing challenge required to prove ownership of a web3 address.

    **Custodial Cardholder** Create a Funding Source that usese the [Custodial Funding
    Protocol](https://docs.immersve.com/guides/custodial-funding-protocol/).
    The external id parameter is required.

    **Simulator** Create a Funding Source that usese the [Simulator Funding
    Protocol](https://docs.immersve.com/guides/simulator-funding-protocol/). No
    additional parameters are required.
