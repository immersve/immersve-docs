summary: Submit Residential Addresses
operationId: submit-residential-addresses
description: Submit residential addresses for the cardholder. The request body should contain an array with the cardholder's current residential address either structured or unstructured. We recommend using a structured address whenever possible as correct parsing of an unstructured address is not guaranteed. Immersve will try to structure a submitted unstructured address only for addresses in New Zealand and Australia. If this is successful, the response body will contain the structured variant along with the submitted unstructured address.
parameters:
  - name: cardholderAccountId
    in: path
    description: ID of the cardholder account.
