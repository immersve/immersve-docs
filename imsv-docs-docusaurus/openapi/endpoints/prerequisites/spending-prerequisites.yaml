  summary: Get spending prerequisites
  description: |
    This endpoint specifies the necessary prerequisites that must be met for a cardholder to successfully create a card and transact with it against a specified Funding Source.
    The caller can specify the desired spend and receive the necessary transactions required, accounting for existing deposits, to deposit funds on-chain to meet that spend.
    It includes any KYC and AML requirements.

      description: |
        User is not allowed to perform the action with the reason stated in the `errorCode`

        **FORBIDDEN**
        Insufficient permissions to perform the action.

        **LIVENESS_MISMATCH**
        Resource liveness does not match request liveness.

        **CARD_PROGRAM_INVALID**
        Card program does not belong to a partner this cardholder is associated with.

        **FUNDING_SOURCE_INVALID**
        Funding source cannot be used with this card program.

        **KYC_PROFILE_REGION_MISMATCH**
        The KYC profile is already passed for a region different from the requested region. Use [Get a KYC profile](/get-a-kyc-profile/) endpoint to get the current region of the KYC profile. If the current region suits, request spending prerequisites again, while specifying that region, to get the remaining prerequisites. If your integration requires a specific region other than the current one, the user cannot proceed with getting their Immersve card and they must register with a new wallet.

        **AML_CHECK_FAILED**
        AML check failed. This cannot be resolved.

        **UNSUPPORTED_KYC_REGION**
        The KYC region is not yet supported.
