  description: |
    Check for outstanding cardholder "Spending Prerequisites". Clients should
    use the returned prerequisite instructions to guide the user through the
    card onboarding user journey.

    Spending prerequisites are divided into three stages: Funding, KYC, and AML.
    When each of these three stages indicate the status is "ok" then the
    cardholder can proceed to transact with their card.

    See the [KYC Spending Prerequisites](https://docs.immersve.com/guides/kyc-spending-prerequisites/)
    guide for more details about how to consume the prerequisite instructions
    for your cardholder onboarding experience.
