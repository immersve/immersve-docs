  This API uses cursor-based pagination. Start by making a request without a cursor to get the first page. Use the nextCursor from the pageInfo in the response as the cursor for subsequent requests to retrieve further pages. Empty pages can be expected, subsequent requests may return more items. Continue until nextCursor is undefined, indicating no more data.
