    Set a new PIN on a card.
    ___________________________________________________________
    The following validation rules are applied to the new PIN:
    - Must be exactly four digits
    - Can not be a repeating sequence: `0000`, `1111`, `2222`, `3333`, `4444`, `5555`, `6666`, `7777`, `8888`, or `9999`
    - Where `Y`, `M`, and `D` represent the customer's date of birth with the format `Y1Y2Y3Y4-M1M2-D1D2`, the PIN digits should not use the formats `Y1Y2Y3Y4`, `M1M2D1D2`, `Y3Y4M2D2`, `Y3Y4M1M2`. For example, if the date of birth is 1 April 1963 the following will not be accepted: 1963, 0401, 6341, 6304
    - Can not be the same as the last four digits of the PAN
    - Can not match any part of the customer's phone number(s)
    - Can not match any part of any reference number for the customer
