  summary: Submit Simulator Clearing
  operationId: submit-simulator-clearing
  description: |
    Test clearing a transaction on a simulated card network. A single clearing
    that references a prior authorization is the most common use case. The
    amount can be for the full or partial amount of the authorization.

    #### Multiple Clearing
    Multiple clearings can be submitted for a single authorization. Multiple
    clearings has e-commerce use cases where clearing happens as items are
    shipped. Clearing amounts are cumulative.
    Use the `clearingMode` field to simulate multiple clearings.

    #### Clearing Mode:
      Signals whether additional clearing messages are expected.
    - **final**: No further clearing message is expected.
    - **multi-non-final**: Additional clearing messages are expected.
    - **multi-final**: This is the final of multiple clearing messages.
