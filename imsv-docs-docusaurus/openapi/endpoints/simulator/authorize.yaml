  summary: Submit Simulator Authorization
  operationId: submit-simulator-authorization
  description: |
    This endpoint can be used to test authorizing a transaction on a simulated
    card network. 

    #### Incremental Authorization
    Create an initial authorization then include the `requestMsg` from this
    response in the request body of a subsequent authorization.

    #### Force Post
    In some scenarios a merchant will force an authorization to be accepted. This is
    known as force post or force sale. This functionality supports offline
    authorizations. To simulate this scenario, set the `forcePost` field to `true`
    in your request payload.

    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "./models/authorize-request.yaml"
