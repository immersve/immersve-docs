  summary: Submit Simulator Authorization
  operationId: submit-simulator-authorization
  description: |
    This endpoint can be used to test authorizing a transaction on a simulated
    card network. An incremental authorization can be tested by creating an
    initial authorization then including the `requestMsg` from this response in
    the request body of a subsequent authorization.

    In some scenarios, transactions need to be approved regardless of standard
    authorization checks (card details, balance, etc). This is known as force posting. To
    use this scenario, set the `forcePost` field to true in your request payload
  requestBody:
