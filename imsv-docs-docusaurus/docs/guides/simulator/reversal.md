# Reversal

After any of `clearing`, `clearing without auth` and `authorization` have been completed, the transaction can also be reversed using the `reverse` button. When this action is executed, a modal will allow the user to enter a value that is to be reversed. This can be less than the initial value of the previous action, allowing for a partial reversal of the transaction.

Once reversed, the transaction in the Immersve dashboard will show as having its value reduced by the amount that was entered within the process.
