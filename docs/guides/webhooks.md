# Webhooks

Immersve uses webhooks to push real-time notifications to your app.

Immersve sends events to your webhook endpoint as part of a POST request with a JSON payload. Your webhook must return a `200` response. If a `200` response is not received, Immersve will retry sending the notification with exponential backoff. Immersve has a maximum retry delay of 12 hours.

## Steps to receive webhooks

You can start receiving event notifications in your app using the steps in this section:

1. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local server.
2. Handle requests from Immersve by parsing each event object and returning a `200` response status code.
3. Deploy your webhook endpoint so itâ€™s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
4. [Contact Immersve](mailto:info@immersve.com) to register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
