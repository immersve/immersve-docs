# Webhooks

Immersve uses webhooks to push real-time notifications to your app.

Immersve sends events to your webhook endpoint as part of a POST request with a JSON payload. Your webhook must return
a `200` response. If a `200` response is not received, Immersve will retry sending the notification with exponential
backoff. Immersve has a maximum retry delay of 12 hours.

There are multiple webhooks that Immersve sends to your app:

- [Authorization](/api-reference/authorization) - Sales and Authorization requests
- [Transaction](/api-reference/transaction) - Clearing and Refund requests
- [Card Status Change](/api-reference/card-status-change) - Card status changes

## Steps to receive webhooks

You can start receiving event notifications in your app using the steps in this section:

1. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local
   server [Webhook API Reference](/api-reference/webhooks-custodial).
2. Handle requests from Immersve by parsing each event object and returning a `200` response status code.
3. Deploy your webhook endpoint so itâ€™s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
4. [Contact Immersve](mailto:support@immersve.com) to register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
