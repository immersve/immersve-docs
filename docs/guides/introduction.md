# Introduction

The particular set of guides that are relevant to your use case is dependent upon the context in which payment cards are to be funded. If end users will directly control the means by which cards will be funded (i.e. they hold the private key controlling the relevant blockchain address) then you should refer to the [non-custodial wallet guides](/guides/non-custodial-wallets). If a custodian holds and controls the digital assets that will fund cards, such as a centralized exchange or other custodial wallet, then the [custodial wallet guides](/guides/custodial-wallets) are relevant to your use case.
