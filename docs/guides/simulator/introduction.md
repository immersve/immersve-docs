# Introduction

The simulator app is a test application that enables use of Immersve cards with a fake merchant.

To begin using the simulator, one must first create an Immersve test card with the following steps:
- Visit https://app.immersve.com/config and toggle `ENABLE_TEST_MODE` to on
- Go to https://app.immersve.com and sign in with a new account (donâ€™t use your existing account)
- Create a card

Once a card is acquired you can go to https://app.immersve.com/simulator to use the simulator. 

**NOTE:** You must stay logged into your Immersve account while using the simulator.

Once on the simulator app, you will be given a form to enter your card details into, as well as a series of options as indicated
by the flow diagram below.

    A[Enter Card Details] --> B[Clear Without Auth]
    A --> C[Authorize]
		C --> D[Clear]
    B --> E[Reverse]
		C --> E
		D --> E

```

At any point the `reset` button can be used to restore the application to its initial state, not maintaining any previous transaction history.
