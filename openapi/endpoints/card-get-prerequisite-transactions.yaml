  summary: Get prerequisite transactions
  description: |
    This endpoint returns the requisite blockchain transactions required to permit the creation of a new Immersve Card. 
    It is also intended for integrating clients to check that everything is in place before making the actual web3 transactions.
    Among such things are KYC and AML checks. These are early checks before creating the card to prevent end-users 
    unnecessarily paying for the gas fees of two transactions, should any of the checks fail.

        User is not allowed to get the deposit details with the reason stated in the `message`

        **KYC_REQUIRED** 
        User is required to perform KYC because they are about to spend the amount that exceeds the KYC-free limit.
        Immersve requires them to provide identification information to comply with regulatory requirements

        **AML_REQUIRED**
        User is not allowed to create a card due to AML Checks Failing
        Immersve AML Provider found that the funding wallet might not comply with AML and canâ€™t check the origin of funds for the provided wallet. User will need to go through AML process to validate the source of the funds on the wallet

        **AML_PERMANENTLY_FAILED**
        Similar to AML_REQUIRED, except the user can not remediate the failing check, because the intended deposit wallet is permanently blacklisted.
