  summary: Get a card token
  description: |
    Generate a card token to enable the subsequent retrieval of the card's sensitive details including full PAN, expiry, CVV2 and embossedName.

    The token can only be used once and subsequent attempts to use it will result in a 403 response.

    The callback url responds with an object containing the card's sensitive details.

    ```json
    {
      "cvv2": "442",
      "pan": "1234123412345678",
      "expiry": "202501",
      "embossedName": "DOE/JOHN"
    }
    ```
