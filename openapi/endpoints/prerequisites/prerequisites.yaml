        User is not allowed to get the deposit details with the reason stated in the `message`

        **KYC_REQUIRED** 
        User is required to perform KYC because they are about to spend the amount that exceeds the KYC-free limit.
        Immersve requires them to provide identification information to comply with regulatory requirements

        **AML_REQUIRED**
        User is not allowed to create a card due to AML Checks Failing
        Immersve AML Provider found that the funding wallet might not comply with AML and canâ€™t check the origin of funds for the provided wallet. User will need to go through AML process to validate the source of the funds on the wallet

        **AML_PERMANENTLY_FAILED**
        Similar to AML_REQUIRED, except the user can not remediate the failing check, because the intended deposit wallet is permanently blacklisted.
