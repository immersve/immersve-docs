Throughout the card lifecycle the current state is used to determine the capabilities of the card. For example, cards must be activated before they can be used for purchases or other such activity. Immersve manages the lifecycle of cards, acting upon inputs from clients and other connected systems whilst ensuring that only permitted state transitions are carried out. note Card blocks are a distinct concept from the card lifecycle states Introduction​ As soon as a card is created it will be default to the created state. Depending on the type of card that was created it might be moved into different states automatically at this point. Card state updates can be made at any time once a card is created. The most common instances of card state updates include: Card activation in order to make the card ready for useCard deactivation once the card is no longer needed Card state updates are performed using the Update Card State API. A state must be provided in the request and a memo can optionally be included. Certain card state transitions are carried out automatically without explicit API client interactions. These circumstances include when a physical card moves from created to shipped once the card embossing file has been generated for that card.

Physical cards​ Shipped / Returned / Resent / Sold​ Transitions to shipped, returned, sold and resent states are determined by the data provided by the card personalization bureau. Card activation​ To activate a card, set the state in the request to activated. For security reasons, a physical card cannot be moved from created to activated. Instead, it can only be activated after it is sold or shipped. Card activation ensures that the details of a physical card cannot be used until it is delivered to the customer and activated. You can alternatively activate a card by setting the card Personal Identification Number (PIN) for the first time. Card deactivation​ Once a card is no longer needed, the card can be deactivated. When a card is deactivated, a card block is created on the card so that it can no longer be used. To deactivate a card, set the state in the request to invalid. Once a card has been set to invalid, it can no longer be transitioned to another state. You can cancel the card by calling the cancel a card operation. You can alternatively deactivate a card by selecting the option when reissuing a card.

A physical card is an object that is encoded with unique card data during manufacture and is delivered to a cardholder. Physical cards let cardholders hold the data pertaining to their card on their person. Immersve supports physical card issuance and manufacture via the card creation API operation. Immersve does not ourselves produce physical cards; rather we integrate with card manufacturers who handle physical card production and shipping. As a client, you can request to create a physical card using the Immersve APIs. Immersve then includes the particulars of the newly-created card within an embossing file and sends it to your chosen card manufacturer partner. The physical card order flow is as shown in the following diagram. flowchart LR Create_card([Create card])--&gt;Generate_card([Generate card]) Queue_embossing_file([Queue embossing file])--&gt;Manufacture_card([Manufacture card]) subgraph Card Manufacturer direction TB Manufacture_card([Manufacture card])--&gt;Ship_card([Ship card]) end subgraph Immersve direction TB Generate_card([Generate card])--&gt;Generate_embossing_file([Generate embossing file]) Generate_embossing_file([Generate embossing file])--&gt;Queue_embossing_file([Queue embossing file]) end subgraph API Client direction TB Create_card([Create card]) end Contact us to find out if your preferred card manufacturer can be supported. Prerequisites​ Immersve must be securely integrated with the card manufacturing partner in order to provide card embossing files. Immersve integrates with card manufacturers by registering the manufacturer as a partner and issuing access credentials for their system. Typical steps to get set up with a card manufacturer include: Create card designsAcquire approval from your card networkProduce blank card plasticCreate card collateral Stock levels are not managed or recorded as part of the Immersve physical card orders process. For information on stock levels, work with your card manufacturer. To place a physical card order with Immersve, create a card referencing a particular card program. When a card order has been placed, information about the ordered card will be added to your embossing file. This file is then sent to your card manufacturer. Physical card order fulfillment​ After you complete a physical card order, Immersve generates a file containing all the information required for the cards to be produced. The ordered cards are included in the file. The embossing file supports orders for individual cards as well as bulk card orders. The embossing file consists of two parts: information about the entire order, contained in the cards object, and information about all the cards in the order, contained in the cards object. Order information​ The embossing file is sent to card manufacturers once per day. Each file includes all cards that have been created since the last time the file was generated. The embossing file can also be sent in batches. caution Because the embossing file is sent only once daily, submitting multiple physical card orders for the same cardholder but to different shipping addresses can only be done at least 1 day apart. When your card manufacturer receives the embossing file, the cards will be produced according to the order information in the file. When the cards have been produced, they will be shipped to your customers or specified branch locations. Physical card shipping​ Physical card shipping will be managed by the card manufacturer. When an order for a physical card has been placed, it typically goes through the following sequence of card states: After the card order has been placed and the card is created in the database, its state is created.When the card order information has been sent to the card manufacturer, its state changes to shipped.If the card is returned before reaching the customer, its state changes to returned.If a Point-of-Sale (POS) has been configured and the card is sold at a POS, its state changes to sold.If the card is being resent to the customer address, its state changes to resent.When the card is activated and ready to be used, its card state changes to activated.If the card is deactivated, its card state changes to invalid.","keywords":""},{"title":"Introduction","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"guides/introduction","content":"Introduction The particular set of guides that are relevant to your use case is dependent upon the context in which payment cards are to be funded.

As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. Immersve treat virtual cards as being logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a traditional persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced. The use of web3-native authentication mechanisms within the context of card issuance mean that the same level of protection to a user's funds in self-custodial wallets is applied to their activities as a cardholder. Prior to being permitted to order a card a user must first have successfully authenticated and locked digital assets within the smart contract via digital asset transfer and smart contract invocations as instructed by the get prerequisite transactions operation. Authentication​ The authentication processes is described in the authentication guide. As the user account is anchored by control of the private key, there is no distinct prior explicit registration or signup process needed before authenticating. Currency Conversion​ A user will more often than not be quoted a price for a purchase by a merchant in a fiat currency. In order to determine the sufficient amount of digital assets to fund a card and be made available for the purchase, you will retrieve the amount from the currency conversion API endpoint. Lock Funds​ In order to ensure that funds are sufficiently locked within the smart contract such that Immersve are in a position to approve an authorization request received via the card scheme network you will need to have firstly locked sufficient digital assets within the smart contract via digital asset transfer and smart contract invocations as instructed by the get prerequisite transactions operation. The necessary blockchain transactions are contained within the requiredTransactions collection returned. If the user has not transacted using the solution before then the the get prerequisite transactions response will typically call for and erc20_approval in favour of the smart contract followed by a depositAndCreateLockedFund invocation of the smart contract. If multiple transactions are present then they should be carried out in the order in which they are presented. The client application is to parse and formulate the raw blockchain transaction message such that it is presented to the user within the web3 wallet and signed and sent to the relevant blockchain. Wallet Funding for Development and Testing​ To ensure that integrators are able to obtain sufficient ERC-20 tokens to facilitate development and testing, Immersve uses an ERC-20 token contract that allows tokens to be freely minted as needed. In non-production environments any erc20_approval transaction type returned by get prerequisite transactions will refer to the &quot;IMMUSDC&quot; token. The &quot;IMMUSDC&quot; token has a mint function allowing for the unlimited minting of the token to any wallet address. One particularly convenient way to get the necessary tokens is to use the Polygonscan interface. Open the IMMUSDC token in PolygonscanClick Write as ProxyClick Connect to Web3 to connect your wallet with PolygonscanOpen the mint functionSet the destination wallet address (where assets are to be sent) in the to field. Set an amount in the amount field.Initiate the web3 transaction clicking the Write buttonConfirm the transaction in the web3 wallet and pay the gas fees Order a Card​ With the funds locked in the smart contract, it's now time to order a card. Call the order a card operation to request Immersve to generate a card. The returned card data returned in response to a order a card request includes only truncated or masked sensitive data. Single-use virtual cards are activated and ready to use by default.

There are two steps in this process; firstly, obtaining a token for transmission to the client application to which the card details are to be provided (i.e. the application that will display the card data to the cardholder) and;secondly, the exchange, by that client application, of the token for the card data. note It is not recommended that the card token is supplied to any application other than one that resides within the cardholder environment (i.e. their mobile application or web application running in their browser) unless that system is sufficiently compliant with PCI-DSS requirements and is audited as such. Get a Card Token​ Generate a single-use card token using the get a card token operation. The token is typically then transmitted to the cardholder's environment (i.e. web application or mobile application running in their web browser) to complete the final step completing the card issuance. Get Card Details​ To obtain the full PAN and CVV2 for display to the cardholder your client-side application should exchange the token for the sensitive card data via the get secure card details operation.
