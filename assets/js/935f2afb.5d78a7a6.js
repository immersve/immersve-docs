If end users will directly control the means by which cards will be funded (i.e. they hold the private key controlling the relevant blockchain address) then you should refer to the non-custodial wallet guides.

As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. Immersve treat virtual cards as being logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a traditional persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced. The use of web3-native authentication mechanisms within the context of card issuance mean that the same level of protection to a user\'s funds in self-custodial wallets is applied to their activities as a cardholder.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/authorization-reports":{"id":"guides/reports/authorization-reports","title":"Authorization Reports","description":"The authorization report can be used to review all card purchase authorizations for a given period.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/clearing-reports":{"id":"guides/reports/clearing-reports","title":"Clearing Reports","description":"The clearing report can be used to review all card purchase clearings for a given period.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/introduction":{"id":"guides/reports/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Immersve can generate reports for a given card program over a time period that suits your needs.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/simulator/authorization":{"id":"guides/simulator/authorization","title":"Authorization","description":"An authorization is an initial step in a transaction that checks if funds are available and sets up the approval for the transaction.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/simulator/clearing":{"id":"guides/simulator/clearing","title":"Clearing","description":"A clearing acts in a very similar way to clearing without auth, however the card information that is used is based upon the initial authorization that was executed.

This allows for partial clearings to be made, where the amount being cleared may be less than the initial amount of authorized funds.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/simulator/clearing-without-auth":{"id":"guides/simulator/clearing-without-auth","title":"Clearing Without Auth","description":"Instead of authorizing first, a payment can be made by outright creating a clearing.
