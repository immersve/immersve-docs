As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. Immersve treat virtual cards as being logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a traditional persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced. The use of web3-native authentication mechanisms within the context of card issuance mean that the same level of protection to a user\'s funds in self-custodial wallets is applied to their activities as a cardholder.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/authorization-reports":{"id":"guides/reports/authorization-reports","title":"Authorization Reports","description":"The authorization report can be used to review all card purchase authorizations for a given period.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/clearing-reports":{"id":"guides/reports/clearing-reports","title":"Clearing Reports","description":"The clearing report can be used to review all card purchase clearings for a given period.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/reports/introduction":{"id":"guides/reports/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Immersve can generate reports for a given card program over a time period that suits your needs.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/simulator/authorization":{"id":"guides/simulator/authorization","title":"Authorization","description":"An authorization is an initial step in a transaction that checks if funds are available and sets up the approval for the transaction.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/simulator/clearing":{"id":"guides/simulator/clearing","title":"Clearing","description":"A clearing acts in a very similar way to clearing without auth, however the card information that is used is based upon the initial authorization that was executed.
