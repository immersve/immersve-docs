As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. By default, virtual cards are logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced.","permalink":"/guides/issue-a-virtual-card"},{"id":"guides/non-custodial-wallets","title":"Non-Custodial Wallets","description":"Decentralized applications (such as DeFi and GameFi dApps) or web3 wallets themselves may support card issuance flows utilizing various web3 technologies. Cardholder accounts may be funded by way of either the end user\'s non-custodial wallet or, in some cases, via intermediary smart contract deposits.","permalink":"/guides/non-custodial-wallets"}]}')}}]);
