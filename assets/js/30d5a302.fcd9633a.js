As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. By default, virtual cards are logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced.","permalink":"/guides/issue-a-virtual-card"},{"id":"guides/monetary-units","title":"Monetary Units","description":"Minor Units Format","permalink":"/guides/monetary-units"}]}')}}]);
