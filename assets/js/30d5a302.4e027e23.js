As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. Immersve treat virtual cards as being logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represented within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a traditional persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced. The use of web3-native authentication mechanisms within the context of card issuance mean that the same level of protection to a user\'s funds in self-custodial wallets is applied to their activities as a cardholder.","permalink":"/guides/issue-a-virtual-card"}]}')}}]);
