If end users will directly control the means by which cards will be funded (i.e. they hold the private key controlling the relevant blockchain address) then you should refer to the non-custodial wallet guides. If a custodian holds and controls the digital assets that will fund cards, such as a centralized exchange or other custodial wallet, then the custodial wallet guides are relevant to your use case.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/non-custodial wallets/authentication":{"id":"guides/non-custodial wallets/authentication","title":"Authentication","description":"Accounts are identified by way of blockchain addresses. Proof of ownership of an address is based upon a process of authentication by way of verification of EIP-4361 challenges signed by the private key underlying an address. Upon successful authentication, Immersve will issue an access token for subsequent use in interactions with the Immersve API.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/non-custodial wallets/card-lifecycle":{"id":"guides/non-custodial wallets/card-lifecycle","title":"Card Lifecycle","description":"Card States","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"guides/non-custodial wallets/issue-a-virtual-card":{"id":"guides/non-custodial wallets/issue-a-virtual-card","title":"Issue a Virtual Card","description":"A virtual card is a payment card that exists only in digital form. As such, virtual cards are most suitable for online e-commerce purchases as opposed to in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar merchants. Immersve treat virtual cards as being logically time-bound and ephemeral. Beginning at the time of issuance of a virtual card, it has a finite useable lifespan which is often represeted within the UI of the issuing client application as a stopwatch-type timer. This model presents certain benefits over a traditional persistent payment card model (be they virtual, tokenized or physical) in that the potential for card fraud is dramatically reduced. The use of web3-native authentication mechanisms within the context of card issuance mean that the same level of protection to a user\'s funds in self-custodial wallets is applied to their activities as a cardholder.","sidebar":"primarySidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Getting Started","description":"Immersve is a multi-chain payment protocol and web3 / metaverse Mastercard\xae product.
